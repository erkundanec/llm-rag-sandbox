    "\n",
    "### 1. Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search your private knowledge base for information relevant to the query\n",
    "- Like Google search, but for your specific documents\n",
    "- Uses \"semantic search\" - finds documents similar in meaning, not just keyword matches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take the retrieved information and inject it into the prompt\n",
    "- \"Here's some context before I answer your question...\"\n",
    "- The LLM now has fresh, specific information to work with\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LLM produces an answer using:\n",
    "  - Its general knowledge (from training)\n",
    "  - The retrieved context (your specific data)\n",
    "- Result: More accurate, grounded, and specific answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Retrieval?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs have two key limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Knowledge cutoff - They only know what they were trained on\n",
    "2. No access to private data - They can't read your company docs, personal notes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG solves both by giving the LLM a \"library card\" to your knowledge base."
