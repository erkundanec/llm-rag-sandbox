Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. 
Each piece of text is converted into a vector (a list of numbers), typically with 
hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Similar texts will have similar vectors, 
measured by distance metrics like cosine similarity. This allows computers to 
understand that "dog" and "puppy" are related, even though the words are different.
