Semantic search goes beyond keyword matching to understand the intent and meaning 
behind queries. If you search for "What pets are good for apartments?", semantic 
search understands you want information about small, quiet animals, even if documents 
don't contain those exact words. It works by comparing the meaning (embeddings) of 
your query against document embeddings, finding conceptually similar content.
