Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed to efficiently store and 
search high-dimensional vectors. Unlike traditional databases that search for exact 
matches, vector databases find approximate nearest neighbors. Popular vector databases 
include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and FAISS. They enable semantic search, where you 
can find documents similar in meaning rather than just keyword matches.
