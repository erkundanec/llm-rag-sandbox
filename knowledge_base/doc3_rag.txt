Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language 
models by giving them access to external knowledge. Instead of relying only on 
training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base 
and include it in the prompt. This reduces hallucinations and allows the model 
to answer questions about private or recent data it wasn't trained on.
