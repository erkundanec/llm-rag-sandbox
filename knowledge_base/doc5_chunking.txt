Chunking is the process of breaking large documents into smaller pieces for better 
retrieval. Common strategies include fixed-size chunking (e.g., 500 tokens), 
sentence-based chunking, or paragraph-based chunking. Good chunks should be 
self-contained enough to make sense on their own, but small enough that irrelevant 
information doesn't dilute the meaning. Overlapping chunks can help preserve context 
across boundaries.
